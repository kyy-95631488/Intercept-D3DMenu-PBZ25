## Prerequisites
- **Operating System**: Windows
- **Libraries**:
  - DirectX 9 SDK [Link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812)
  - MinHook library [`libMinHook.x86.lib`](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook)
- **Game**: Point Blank (Zepetto version IDN Server)
- **Compiler**: Compatible with C++ compilers supporting Windows API and Direct3D9 (e.g., MSVC)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kyy-95631488/Intercept-D3DMenu-PBZ25.git
   ```
2. Install the required DirectX 9 SDK and MinHook library.
3. Build the project using a C++ compiler (e.g., Visual Studio).
4. Inject the compiled DLL into the Point Blank process using a DLL injector.

## Usage
- **Toggle Menu**: Press `INSERT` to show/hide the menu.
- **Navigation**: Use `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys to navigate menu items.
- **Adjust Settings**: Use `LEFT` and `RIGHT` arrow keys to toggle or adjust selected options.

## Controls
- **INSERT**: Toggle menu visibility
- **UP/DOWN**: Navigate menu items
- **LEFT/RIGHT**: Adjust selected item (toggle or increment/decrement)

## Code Structure
- **Main File**: Implements a `D3DMenu` class for rendering and handling the cheat menu.
- **Hooks**: Uses MinHook to hook the Direct3D9 `EndScene` function for rendering.
- **Features**:
  - `ToggleESPNameTag`: Patches memory to enable/disable ESP name tags.
  - `ToggleAntiKick`: Patches memory to prevent kicks.
  - `DrawCrosshair`: Renders customizable crosshairs.
  - `DrawESPBody`: Draws ESP boxes and name tags.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Direct3D9 (`d3d9.lib`, `d3dx9.lib`)
  - MinHook (`libMinHook.x86.lib`)

## Building
1. Ensure DirectX 9 SDK and MinHook are installed.
2. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Link against `d3d9.lib`, `d3dx9.lib`, and `libMinHook.x86.lib`.
4. Build the solution in Release mode for x86 architecture.
5. The output DLL can be found in the build directory.

## Injection
1. Launch Point Blank.
2. Use a DLL injector (e.g., Xenos, Extreme Injector) or Cheat Engine to inject the compiled DLL into `PointBlank.exe`.
3. A success message will appear if the injection is successful.

## Notes
- **Use at Your Own Risk**: This is a cheat tool and may violate the game's terms of service, potentially leading to bans.
- **Compatibility**: Tested with Point Blank (Zepetto). May require updates for different game versions.
- **Logging**: Outputs logs to the console and debugger for debugging purposes.
